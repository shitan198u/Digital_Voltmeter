### Making a digital voltmeter using Arduino

#### Introduction:

In many electronic projects, it is important to monitor the voltage of a battery to ensure that it is operating within safe limits. If the voltage drops too low, the battery may not be able to power the device properly, and if the voltage goes too high, it could damage the device or the battery itself. In this project, we will use an Arduino and an LCD display to create a battery voltage monitor that can be used to monitor the voltage of a battery in real-time.

#### Hardware:

The hardware required for this project is relatively simple. We need the following components:

* Arduino board
* 16x2 LCD display
* Resistors (for the voltage divider circuit)
* Voltage divider circuit components (to reduce the battery voltage to a measurable level for the Arduino's analog input pins)
* 5V reference voltage for the Arduino's analog-to-digital converter (ADC)

The voltage divider circuit consists of two resistors, R1 and R2, connected in series. The battery voltage is connected across the two resistors, and the voltage at the junction between R1 and R2 is measured by the Arduino. The formula for calculating the input voltage is:

V = (R2 / (R1 + R2)) × Vbat

Where Vbat is the battery voltage.

#### Software:

The software for this project is relatively simple as well. Here are the steps:

1. Initialize the LCD display in the setup function and print a message to indicate that we are monitoring the battery voltage.
2. In the loop function:
    * Read the analog value from the voltage divider circuit using the `analogRead` function.
    * Convert the analog value to voltage using the formula: V = (analog_value × 5.0) / 1024.0. This gives us the voltage at the junction between R1 and R2.
    * Calculate the battery voltage using the formula: V = (R2 / (R1 + R2)) × Vbat.
    * Add a conditional statement to ensure that the battery voltage is not less than 0.1V, which is the minimum voltage required for most batteries to operate.
    * Display the battery voltage on the LCD display using the `lcd.print` function.
    * Send the battery voltage to the serial monitor using the `Serial.print` and `Serial.println` functions.
    * Add a delay of 200 milliseconds to prevent the display from flickering too much.

That's it! With this setup, you can create a digital voltmeter using Arduino to monitor the voltage of a battery in real-time.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the battery voltage monitor is a simple and useful project that can be used to monitor the voltage of a battery in real-time. By using an Arduino and an LCD display, we can easily monitor the battery voltage and ensure that it is operating within safe limits. The project is easy to implement, and the code is straightforward. The battery voltage monitor can be used in various applications that rely on battery power, such as robots, drones, and portable electronic devices.
